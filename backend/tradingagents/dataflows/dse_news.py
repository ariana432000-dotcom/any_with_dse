DSE news vendor -- combines two sources:

  1. dsebd.org's news archive, via `bdshare.get_all_news` /
     `bdshare.get_price_sensitive_news` -- per-ticker corporate disclosures
     (EPS, NAV, dividend, AGM, etc.). Uses the maintained `bdshare` library
     (see dse_stock_data.py's docstring for why) instead of the hand-rolled
     scraper this file originally shipped with.

  2. sharenews24.com -- general Bangladeshi share-market news (market
     commentary, macro, IPO news). Plain server-rendered HTML, no JS
     rendering needed, not covered by bdshare.

Matches the get_news / get_global_news contract from news_data_tools.py, so
this registers as a "news_data" vendor exactly like yfinance_news.py.

✅ FIXED: this module used to duplicate (and not fix) several bugs that were
found and fixed in app/pipeline/market_data.py's `_fetch_dse_news` for the
watchlist feature. Since `route_to_vendor` auto-forces every DSE ticker to
THIS module for get_news/get_global_news with no fallback vendor, those bugs
were live in the main analysis pipeline the whole time:
  - sharenews24 was matched against the raw ticker code ("SQURPHARMA"),
    which never appears in a real headline (only "Square Pharmaceuticals"
    does) -- silently matched nothing, ever.
  - relatedly, even headline-only company-name matching is insufficient on
    this site: a large share of its coverage is "roundup" articles (Top 10
    gainers, "Four companies gave the index confidence today") where the
    headline names no company at all, and the company names only appear in
    body paragraphs -- confirmed live, see market_data.py's
    _load_sharenews24_articles docstring for the specific example.
  - get_price_sensitive_news(code=ticker) has no client-side re-check, but
    DSE's server ignores the code= filter for that endpoint (confirmed:
    an ABBANK request returned EXCH/EIL/IPDC items) -- so a ticker's "news"
    silently included other companies' disclosures.
  - no per-call cap -- get_price_sensitive_news() has been observed
    returning ~492 rows in one response, all of which got dumped unbounded
    into the LLM prompt.
  - no throttling around bdshare/dsebd.org calls, risking the same
    "Connection pool is full" issue fixed elsewhere via a semaphore.

Rather than re-fix (and risk re-diverging from) the same logic twice, this
module now reuses the already-fixed helpers directly from
app.pipeline.market_data: company-name resolution (incl. Bengali variants),
the cached full-article-body sharenews24 store, the matching logic, and the
concurrency semaphore. (tradingagents already depends on app.pipeline
elsewhere -- see symbol_utils.py's `_llm_guess_dse_ticker`, which imports
from app.pipeline.llm -- so this follows the same, already established,
layering.)

"""
Full financial-statement extraction for DSE-listed companies.

Unlike US tickers (Alpha Vantage / yfinance), there is no single API or
scrape target that returns a clean, structured balance sheet / income
statement / cash flow for a Bangladeshi listed company -- DSE and BSEC
both only publish these as audited-annual-report PDFs, and the PDF layout
differs company to company (and often year to year for the same company).

This module:
  1. Reads a locally-stored annual report PDF for the ticker + fiscal year.
     You (or a small per-company downloader you write later) put these on
     disk yourself -- see REPORTS_DIR below. DSE's own site disallows
     automated crawling in robots.txt, so treat dsebd.org's "Financial
     Statements" tab and company investor-relations pages as
     browse-and-download-by-hand sources rather than scrape targets.
  2. Extracts the statement pages with pdfplumber (layout-aware, better
     for tables than plain text extraction).
  3. Sends that text to an LLM and asks for strict JSON matching an
     Alpha-Vantage-shaped schema, so fundamentals_analyst.py and the rest
     of the pipeline don't need to change to consume it.
  4. Caches the structured result to disk keyed by ticker + fiscal year,
     since PDF parsing + the LLM call are the expensive part and a given
     annual report never changes once published.

Expected PDF layout on disk:
    data/dse_reports/<TICKER>/<FISCAL_YEAR>.pdf
    e.g. data/dse_reports/SQURPHARMA/2025.pdf

Notes on the numbers you'll get back:
  - BD companies commonly use a July-to-June fiscal year (per BSEC
    directive), and P/E / EPS figures on DSE itself are calculated on
    that convention -- don't assume calendar-year alignment when you
    compare fiscalDateEnding across tickers.
  - Figures in the source PDF may be reported in BDT thousands, lakhs, or
    crores depending on the company. The extraction prompt asks the model
    to normalize to plain BDT and note the original unit, but spot-check
    a few results against the PDF before trusting them at scale.

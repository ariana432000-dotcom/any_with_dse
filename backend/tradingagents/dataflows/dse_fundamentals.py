"""
DSE (Dhaka Stock Exchange) fundamentals vendor.

Exposes the same function signatures as alpha_vantage_fundamentals.py so it
can be dropped into interface.py / config.py as a new `fundamental_data`
vendor (see the wiring notes at the bottom of this file).

Two tiers of data:
  1. Headline snapshot ratios (EPS, NAV, P/E, dividend, sponsor holding) --
     scraped from the DSE company page (dsebd.org). Works for any listed
     ticker, always available, cheap.
  2. Full statements (balance sheet / income statement / cash flow) -- DSE
     does not publish these in structured form anywhere, so they are
     extracted from the company's audited annual report PDF via
     dse_statement_extractor.py. See that file for how PDFs get onto disk.

IMPORTANT -- dsebd.org's robots.txt disallows automated crawling. This
module is meant for a personal/academic project: keep request volume low
(DSE_REQUEST_DELAY_SECONDS below), identify your bot honestly in the
User-Agent, and don't run it as a high-frequency or commercial scraper.
If you need reliable, high-volume access, that's a conversation to have
with DSE/BSEC directly rather than something to script around quietly.

    dropping our own UA override wasn't enough by itself. bdshare ships
    its own get_company_info(), which hits this EXACT same
    displayCompany.php endpoint successfully, via its safe_get() helper --
    which retries up to 3 times with exponential back-off AND tries both
    the primary and alt host on every single attempt (up to 6 tries total
    by default), instead of the one-shot, no-retry fetch this function
    was doing. If dsebd.org's 403 here is a transient rate-limit/WAF
    flake rather than a hard, permanent IP-level block, that retry
    resilience is very plausibly the actual difference between "works"
    (bdshare's OHLCV/news calls, and bdshare's own get_company_info) and
    "doesn't" (this function, one attempt, no retry). Reusing bdshare's
    own proven safe_get() directly -- rather than reimplementing a
    thinner version of the same retry/fallback logic ourselves -- is the
    more robust fix. This only changes HOW the HTML is fetched; our own
    downstream parsing (_parse_label_value_tables) is unchanged, since we
    need label:value pairs, not bdshare's pd.read_html() table shape.
    If this STILL 403s after retries, that's strong evidence the block is
    IP-based (e.g. Railway's datacenter range flagged) rather than
    request-shape-based -- test the same code from a non-datacenter

    🔴 FIXED (confirmed live via the Fundamentals Check debug view):
    dsebd.org's page mixes two different row layouts. Some rows are clean
    "<td>Label</td><td>Value</td>" pairs (handled by the original logic
    below). Others -- confirmed live, e.g. a row whose two cells were
    literally "Trading Code:BEXIMCO" and "Scrip Code:99613" -- pack a
    compact "Label:Value" INSIDE each cell of a 2-column grid, so treating
    cell[0] as the label and cell[1] as the value for the whole row
    produced garbage entries like {"Trading Code:BEXIMCO": "Scrip
    Code:99613"}. This is exactly the section that holds P/E, EPS, and
    Market Capitalization, so those never made it into `fields` under any
    recognizable label. Now: a 2-cell row where NEITHER cell contains a
    colon is still treated as the classic label|value pair; otherwise,
    every cell is checked independently for its own "Label:Value" content
    and split on the first colon.

    🔴 FIXED (confirmed live via a real dsebd.org screenshot, ISLAMIBANK):
    P/E ratio and EPS live in WIDE time-series tables --
    "Particulars | Jul 28, 2026 | Jul 29, 2026 | ... | Aug 04, 2026" --
    not simple 2-cell rows, which is why they never appeared under any
    label at all before (neither branch above matches a 7-cell row).
    For rows with more than 2 cells: take the label from column 0, and
    the RIGHTMOST cell that actually has a reported number as that row's
    "current/latest" value -- skipping "-"/"n/a" placeholder columns for
    periods with no data yet. Two consequences confirmed against the real
    page: (1) a fully-dashed row (e.g. the "un-audited" P/E table, before
    the audited figures exist) contributes nothing rather than a bogus
    entry; (2) a pure-header wide row (e.g. "Earnings per share(EPS) |
    EPS - Continuing Operations | NAV Per Share | ...", where every
    "value" cell is text, not a number) also contributes nothing --
    fixing the earlier "Earnings per share(EPS): EPS - Continuing
    Operations" garbage as a side effect, since no cell there is numeric.

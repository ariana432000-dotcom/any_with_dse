Each factory takes an LLM and returns a `node(state)` callable that reads from a
shared state dict and returns updates, exactly as in the notebook. TradingAgents

RULES:
- Use ONLY the numbers below. Do NOT invent any figures.
- If a metric shows N/A, say "data not available".
- Missing/N/A fields are a normal, common limitation -- by themselves they
  are NOT a reason to default to HOLD. Base your verdict on what the
  available numbers actually show. If the core figures you DO have (P/E,
  EPS, revenue, profitability, debt levels) clearly point one direction,
  give a decisive BUY or SELL and say plainly which data points you
  couldn't factor in and why that doesn't change the call.
- Reserve HOLD for when the available data is itself genuinely mixed or
  conflicting (e.g. strong profitability but rising debt, or a cheap P/E
  alongside deteriorating cash flow) -- not merely incomplete. "I don't
  have every field" is not a basis for HOLD on its own.
- Use the given "Current Price" figure as-is whenever you reference the
  stock's price (e.g. comparing to the 50-Day SMA). Do NOT derive a
  price from P/E x EPS or any other combination -- that produces a
  theoretical, not the actual traded, price and the two should never be
  conflated. If "Current Price" itself is N/A, say price data isn't
  available rather than computing a substitute.

No social-sentiment API (StockTwits, Reddit, Finnhub) has usable coverage for {company} --
StockTwits/Reddit carry essentially no DSE-listed discussion, and Finnhub's sentiment
endpoint requires a paid plan and doesn't cover DSE names anyway. Your sole grounded input
is therefore the News Analyst's per-headline sentiment breakdown below. This reflects
news-flow sentiment (what's being reported about the company), not measured market
sentiment (price/volume-derived crowd positioning) -- state this distinction explicitly
in your Data Source Review.

Analyze market sentiment for {company}.
Sections: Data Source Review -> Score Breakdown -> Key Signals -> Confidence Assessment

At the very end, output a Markdown table with EXACTLY these columns:
| Source | Sentiment | Score (1-10) | Confidence | Key Signal |

# realized volatility instead -- the actual market this stock trades in.
# ✅ Endpoint confirmed via bdshare's own source code and its published

# end, code="DSEX") is the real, parameter-validated function for this
# (code is checked against {"DSEX","DSES","DS30","DGEN"} internally).
# Still fails soft (returns {}) rather than raising if the live request
# itself errors (network, dsebd.org downtime, markup change, etc.), so

    not just "RSI: 68.17" / "RSI = 68.17" — an LLM writing prose almost never
    uses the strict label+colon form, so a stricter pattern here would make
    this check silently never fire in practice. The <=20-char gap cap keeps
    it from skipping past to an unrelated number further down the text.

    🔴 FIXED: the gap class used to be `[^0-9\\-]` — any non-digit,
    non-minus character, INCLUDING sentence-ending punctuation. Because
    `re.search` doesn't stop at the label's first occurrence, it just finds
    the first STARTING POSITION where the whole pattern matches — a label
    mention with no number in its own clause (e.g. "RSI reflects oversold
    conditions.") would fail to match at that position and the engine would
    keep sliding forward, happily crossing the period into a completely
    unrelated later clause/sentence ("...analysts still see a 40% chance of
    further downside") and grabbing THAT number instead, mislabeling it as
    the RSI citation. Excluding `.!?\\n` from the gap keeps the match inside
    the same clause/sentence as the label.

    🔴 FIXED (2): used to be "first match wins" and returned a single
    float. Fine for a short final-decision text, but WRONG for multi-round
    debate history ("Bull vs Bear Debate" concatenates every round) and any
    text where a label is mentioned more than once -- the label's genuine,
    correct citation might sit in round 3 while an earlier round used the
    word rhetorically/hypothetically with some unrelated nearby number
    ("if RSI were to slip toward 20, that would signal capitulation") that
    the old first-match logic would grab instead, even though a completely
    correct citation existed elsewhere in the same text. Now returns every
    candidate found across every occurrence of every pattern, so the caller
    can pick the one that actually matches the real reading (see
    check_numeric_contradiction) instead of committing to whichever mention
    the regex happened to reach first.

    """Compares every number the decision text cites against the raw
    ground-truth value, with a generous rounding tolerance (2% relative or
    0.5 absolute) so "same number, fewer decimals" is never confused with a
    genuinely wrong figure. Pure Python — no LLM arithmetic judgment.

    🔴 FIXED: now also returns `n_checked` (how many tracked figures the
    decision text actually cited and got compared), not just the list of
    mismatches. Previously the caller only ever surfaced this function's
    output when `mismatches` was non-empty (see run_decision_verifier's
    notes-building) -- so "every cited number matched" and "the decision
    text never cited any of these figures at all" produced IDENTICAL
    silence in the UI, with no way to tell a genuine numeric verification
    apart from nothing having been checked in the first place.

    ✅ CHANGED: `skip_eps` -- confirmed live (BATBC) that DSE tickers
    routinely have SEVERAL simultaneously-valid, genuinely-different EPS
    figures on the books at once (Q1-only, H1 cumulative, prior-year
    comparative, last full audited year -- e.g. BATBC's own disclosures
    show 3.88 for Q1 2026 alone vs a cumulative/derived ~7.65 for H1).
    fund_metrics only ever holds ONE of these. A tolerance check assumes
    there's a single ground truth the decision text should match, which
    doesn't hold here -- the LLM legitimately citing a *different*,
    equally-real EPS figure than the one in fund_metrics isn't an error,
    and this check has no way to tell that apart from an actual
    hallucinated number. Set skip_eps=True (DSE tickers) rather than
    guess a looser tolerance, since no fixed tolerance is principled when
    the two numbers are correctly describing different reporting
    periods. RSI/MACD/P-E aren't affected -- those remain single-valued
    for a given ticker+date.

    ✅ CHANGED: `tolerance_floor` -- the final decision text is a single,
    authoritative, structured output and should be held to the tight
    default (0.5 absolute / 2% relative). Earlier debate/proposal stages
    are conversational prose written across multiple rounds by different
    "voices" (bull/bear/aggressive/conservative/etc) synthesizing from
    each other -- a little rounding drift when paraphrasing a figure
    someone else stated two paragraphs up (e.g. RSI 31.66 restated as
    ~30) is normal and not the kind of error this check exists to catch.
    Callers checking debate_texts pass a wider floor so that small,
    plausible drift doesn't compete for attention with genuine
    mismatches. See run_decision_verifier for the two call sites."""

- HOLD is a legitimate, self-consistent conclusion whenever the inputs are mixed --

  sentiment pull the other way. Mentioning a caution/risk factor and then still
  making a call (BUY/HOLD/SELL) is NORMAL trading commentary, not an inconsistency.
- Only answer NO if the decision text's OWN stated reasoning DIRECTLY and STRONGLY
  contradicts its OWN action -- e.g. the text says "this is a clear sell signal" or
  "there is no reason to buy" but then names BUY as the action. A hedge like
  "shows some overbought risk but still has growth potential" followed by BUY is
  CONSISTENT, not a contradiction -- do not flag it.
- Default to YES unless the contradiction is obvious and severe.

Then, in 1-2 short bullet points, if SIGNAL_CONSISTENT is NO, quote the specific
phrase in the decision text whose own reasoning contradicts its own action.

    happened to get repeated verbatim in the PM's final text. `debate_texts`
